## Other practice

JsonParserService: Create a service that takes a JSON string, validates it against a schema, and transforms it into a different structure or format before returning it.

XmlProcessorService: Implement a service that parses XML data, perhaps converts it to JSON, and then applies transformations or validations.

FileStorageService: Build a service that handles the reading and writing of files to disk. You could extend it to handle different file formats and storage strategies.

DataEncryptionService: Practice writing a service that encrypts and decrypts data. You can use Node.js's crypto module to encrypt data before saving it and decrypt it when reading it back.

ImageResizerService: Create a service that takes image data as input, resizes it based on provided parameters, and returns the new image data.

DataNormalizationService: Develop a service that takes in "dirty" data, cleans it, normalizes it to a standard format, and returns the cleaned data.

ApiIntegrationService: Write a service that acts as a client to a third-party API. It should handle the intricacies of API communication such as sending requests, handling responses, and error handling.

AuthenticationService: Implement a service that handles user authentication. This could include checking credentials, generating tokens, and validating tokens.

QueueService: Create a service that interfaces with a message queue. It could enqueue messages, process messages, and handle acknowledgments.

LoggingService: Although NestJS has built-in logging functionality, you could create a more complex logging service that writes logs to various destinations (file, database, external monitoring service) and formats them differently.
